# Reef

A minimalist SSG framework with simple reactivity "islands".

## Quick Start

Add scripts to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "reef",
    "build": "reef build"
}
```

## Requirements

TODO: needs update

At the root of the project, add `content/` folder with `.md` files, and a `template.html` with `{{title}}` and `{{content}}` placeholders.
